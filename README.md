üõ∞Ô∏è CSFAFormer: Category-Selective Feature Aggregation Transformer for Multimodal Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation


üìñ Introduction

CSFAFormer (Category-Selective Feature Aggregation Transformer) is a novel multimodal semantic segmentation framework designed to effectively integrate complementary information from RGB, NIR, and ADÔºàDSM or SARÔºâ data.

Our training and testing framework follows UNetFormer (https://github.com/WangLibo1995/GeoSeg), which is a well-established framework, thanks to the author LiBo Wang for sharing it.

The execution command is in Terminal_config.txt.

The relevant code is being organized and will be posted as soon as possible.

We will also upload our complete patch dataset to Baidu Cloud, and the download link will be released later.

We tried uploading it to Google Drive, but due to payment issues, we were unsuccessful. For now, we can only provide the download link from Baidu Cloud.
